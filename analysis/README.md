## Directory for Cluster Analysis

### Important:

In order to carry-out cluster analysis, objects from the EDA step of the project must be present in the R global environment. If not present, either load data backups (*.csv files) or source (or step through) [eda.R](../eda/eda.R "eda.R").  If loading backups, be sure to force column types to ensure validity of data.

## Directory Contents:
* **analysis.R** : script that performs cluster analysis 

N.B.: All project scripts are commented with technical detail where it was deemed that clarification would be helpful. Reading scripts top to bottom is recommended, as comments are typically only provided for the first use of a method, argument, etc.
