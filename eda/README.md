### Directory for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Important:

In order to carry-out exploratory analysis, objects from the munging step of the project must be present in the R global environment. If not present, either load data backups (*.csv files) or source (or step through) [munging-master.R](../munging/munging-master.R "munging-master.R").  If loading backups, be sure to force column types to ensure validity of data.

### Directory contents:
* **eda.R**: script performing all steps of EDA
* **codebook.pdf**: file with data dictionary and descriptive statistics for data used in EDA

N.B.: All project scripts are commented with technical detail where it was deemed that clarification would be helpful. Reading scripts top to bottom is recommended, as comments are typically only provided for the first use of a method, argument, etc.
